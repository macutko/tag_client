# How to start the project:

## Physical device 


**Android:** If you have android physical device, connect device with PC by USB and do the following steps:

1) execute `npm install`
1) run `npm start` in one terminal
1) run `react-native run-android` in another terminal

If your device is plugged in, this should push the app to the device and start the debugging.
The debugging will start showing in the window you ran `npm start` 

**iOS:** Haven't tried yet.

## Virtual Device
**Android:** 
If you want to develop or run this react-native app on AVD - Android Virtual Device - do the following steps (tested on Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS):
1) Do proper Android development setup. Follow steps [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) in section  `React Native CLI Quickstart`
1) check whether `android/gradlew` is executable. If not, go gto `android` folder and execute `chmod 755 gradlew`
1) go to `android` folder, create `local.properties` file and add this line `sdk.dir = /home/USERNAME/Android/Sdk` where USERNAME is your linux username

Afterwards you need to run AVD manually (e.g. in Linux you will go to folder `/home/USERNAME/Android/Sdk/emulator` where Android sdk is
stored by default, execute `./emulator -list-avds` to check which AVDs you have installed and start one of them - in my case I execute 
`./emulator -avd Nexus_5_API_29`)

If your AVD is running (it is the same as you connect your physical device and PC with USB), do the same steps as in **Physical device** section

**iOS:** Haven't tried yet

## Tips
### Debugging 

The simplest way of debugging code is to use Chrome. You donâ€™t need to install any other apps. 
On Android emulator, or shake real devices, you will see the in-app developer menu. Tap `Debug JS Remotely` or `Debug`. 
The Chrome debugger will be opened automatically. You still need to open Developer Tools in Chrome manually (by pressing Ctrl+Shift+J in Linux). 
Open source files in the Sources tab, you can set breakpoints here. More details [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55965037)

## Troubleshooting:

### No server requests work 
Is your server running? Do you have the right `baseUrl` set in `axiosConfig.js`? Is your device able to access 
that destination i.e. are you on the same network (LAN)

### I get errors with react-native <lib> but I haven't touched anything. 

React native libraries tend to be stupid. So, double check if this is not a genuine bug in our code.
If it doesn't seem like it, there is a chance that some caching is broken. In such a case run this:
` del %appdata%\Temp\react-native-* & cd android & gradlew clean & cd .. & del node_modules/ & npm cache clean --force & npm install & npm start -- --reset-cache
`
This works on windows. It might complain about some dir's non existent or something similar, I personally chose to ignore that,
as this is copied from the webs :) but it does the job. 

### react-native is not a recognised comand

Yep, this happens to me if I run the `react-native run-android` command outside of Intelij.
To be honest, I never bothered chasing this further. Soooo, good luck and please let us know :) 

# How to start developing

AFter you have pulled and got the app runing, you can start developing. Create your own branch,
and find a TODO in the code (either by using Intelij's built in option or a search of the repo)

AFter you've done your job, Merge Request into master and assign to someone to approve.
